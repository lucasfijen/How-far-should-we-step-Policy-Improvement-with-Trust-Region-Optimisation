## Setup

This codebase requires Python 3.6 (or higher). We recommend using Anaconda or Miniconda for setting up the virtual environment. Here's a walk through for the installation and project setup.

```
git clone https://github.com/lucasfijen/ReinforcementLearning
cd Deep-Bayesian-Quadrature-Policy-Optimization
conda create -n rl_final_report python=3.6
conda activate rl_final_report
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
